    <h1>Description</h1>

    <!-- The food description is here. -->
    <p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>
    
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <!-- The ingredient list is here. -->
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>   
        <li>2 Â½ cups bread flour</li>

    <!-- The steps to cook are here. -->
    <h1>Steps</h1>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier. Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
